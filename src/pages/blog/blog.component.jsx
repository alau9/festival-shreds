      <h2>Summer Meltdown Festival Spotlight</h2>
      <div className="content">
        Summer Meltdown is a soul-restoring festival tucked in the PNW
        wilderness that you might not yet have heard of. At the foot of a
        glacier capped mountain and situated right next to a lazy river in
        Darrington Washington, this hidden gem is the perfect getaway for music
        and nature lovers. It can best be described as the summer camp of your
        electric dreams, “where music meets the mountain” and the wild beauty of
        the Pacific Northwest.

        Summer Melters have been melting in various iterations of the festival,
        in multiple different venues over the years since its conception in
        2000. It has a loyal following of attendees who’ve been part of the
        party since the beginning and it is welcoming newcomers with rapid
        growth year after year. It is now the largest locally produced
        independent arts and music festival in the PNW, yet somehow it retains
        that small festival charm. At Summer Meltdown, you get the best of both
        worlds. In the evenings, experience a music festival featuring diverse
        musical acts ranging from rock, funk and electronic. Enjoy your slumber
        (don’t forget your earplugs!) under the trees, then spend your day in a
        nature retreat, bringing yourself back to life with a dip in the glacier
        fed lazy river until the late afternoon when it’s time to get ready for
        another round of music.

      <h2>ATTENDING A MUSIC FESTIVAL ON A WHIM</h2>
      <div className="content">
        Purchasing tickets was kind of a leap of faith! I had not really heard
        much about this festival. I admit that my radar was limited to bigger
        scale events featuring primarily DJ sets within the genres I am
        accustomed to. Looking at previous years’ lineups I only knew 2 artists
        - Griz and Grammatik. I love their style but the rest of the lineup was
        a total mystery. In the past, I attended mostly music festivals that
        were purely electronic music - my favourites being trance and
        techno/tech-house/house. But … it’s been a few years since I attended a
        music festival. The last one was in 2017 for Above & Beyond’s ABGT250 at
        The Gorge ... And because three close friends bought tickets to
        Meltdown, my partner and I decided to come along. Bottom line was - We
        love music, we love our friends and we wanted to experience a music
        festival with this crew! And that’s how our little festival crew came
        about!
      </div>
      <h3>
        #SHREDTIP: DON’T BE CAPTIVE TO ONLY ONE GENRE! HAVE AN OPEN MIND. THERE
        IS SO MUCH GOOD MUSIC OUT THERE JUST WAITING FOR YOU TO EXPLORE. YOU
        MIGHT BE SURPRISED BY WHAT YOU FIND!
      </h3>
      <div className="content">
        If you have any friends who love other types of music than your usual
        and they are attending a different type of festival you’d normally go
        to, check out the artists on previous lineups on Spotify! If you kinda
        dig it even just a little bit and it’s within your means, take the
        plunge and get tickets! It was such a cool feeling that every single set
        at Summer Meltdown was a surprise, and now I feel like my musical
        knowledge and taste have expanded and for that I’m so very grateful.

      <h2>GETTING TO SUMMER MELTDOWN & THINGS TO KNOW</h2>
      <div className="content">
        We travelled to Summer Meltdown on Thursday, August 1st from North
        Vancouver, BC. With crossing the border, food break, grocery shopping
        and liquor shopping, it took about 5 hours to reach the venue:
        Darrington Bluegrass Music Park, located 1 1/2 hours Northeast of
        Seattle, or Southeast of Bellingham, WA.

      <div className="content">
        It was a very scenic drive! TIP: PLAN TO ARRIVE EARLY! Gates open at 10
        am for early bird tickets and 2 pm for everyone else on Thursday, the
        first day of the festival. We didn’t arrive until maybe 4 pm and of
        course we waited in a long, sweaty hot lineup. You will probably still
        have to wait in a long lineup but the wait feels less terrible if you
        are earlier. When you get to the gates, volunteers will come to your
        vehicle to give you your weekend wristband and sticker that identifies
        the type of camping you have.
      </div>
      <h4>The main rules to watch out for are:</h4>
      <div>
        You’re welcome to bring up to 100 gifts that you’ve made in the Summer
        Meltdown theme to give away, as long as they don’t use the official logo
        or art. Alcohol Limits: 1 case of beer (24 cans) per person, AND 1.75
        liters of liquor (in a plastic bottle) per person, AND 1 box of wine per
        person per car. Absolutely NO GLASS as it is very difficult to clean up
        and dangerous!
      </div>
      <h2>SUMMER MELTDOWN CAMPING</h2>
      <div className="content">
        Random Tips: With car camping, you can create a more intimate, private
        space for you and your crew. You also don’t need to hike your items in.
        Forest Camping filled up and everyone’s sites seemed to be very close to
        each other. And if you arrive too late, you might be stuck with a
        campsite that’s way too close to the trail. Try to arrive earlier so you
        can choose something a bit more secluded. However, Forest Camping was a
        magical sight to behold. It was so beautiful with the sunlight peeking
        through the trees, hammocks hanging, art displayed. Loved seeing how
        people expressed themselves through their campsites! If you are car
        camping, make sure to arrive early so you can avoid the spots directly
        next to the portapotties. If you are camping in the forest and want to
        be a little crafty, bring a bike and wagon so you can more easily
        transport your things from the car to your spot!{" "}
      </div>
      <h2>SOME LAST TIPS</h2>
      <div className="content">
        The following are packing non negotiables: headlamp, portable charger,
        camping stove, tent, canopy, carpet, chairs, tables, floaties for the
        river, tapestries, giant jug of water and a few refillable bottles,
        battery operated lights, earplugs, eye mask, toilet paper, hand
        sanitizer, wet wipes both to clean up messes and spills and for a tent
        shower to help you feel more refreshed! For extra comfort you can also
        purchase a camping shower from Amazon, fill it up with water from the
        river and hang it up at your campsite. We did this and it was such an
        amazing addition to our campsite. Nothing like a freezing cold morning
        shower to feel refreshed in the heat of the sun! Don’t be shy to ask for
        people’s information! Get their instagram accounts and connect, who
        knows how your friendship will evolve - you might catch them at another
        festival soon!

      <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
      <div className="content-conclusion">
        All in all, Summer Meltdown was a festival that I will never forget.
        While I did a very minimal scan of each artist on the line up on
        Spotify, I mostly walked into the Festival ready to be surprised, and I
        was not disappointed. I get the feeling that newcomers can trust the
        Summer Meltdown organizers to deliver a variety of music from so many
        different genres. Whether it's soulful, funky or downright grimy that
        you like, there is music for everyone at Summer Meltdown. But the thing
        that really stood out for me as a first time melter was how kind and
        welcoming every single person was that my group met. It was an inspiring
        weekend and I hope to continue the Summer Meltdown positive energy and
        creativity into my real life!
